# 3720CharadesGame - Final Project Charades Game using 2 APIs
## Team 4's repo - Ryan, Madison, Ben, Harper

## Running the Game Locally
- First make sure you are on Zoom with your team members
- Each team member needs to download the zip of this repo
- To run the game you must install PyGame
- python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user (some users are able to just do pip install pygame)

## Game Instructions
- Divide your team members up into two teams with even members and choose a score keeper
- Each person starts the game on their individual local device 
- Main menu: Select your genre of Charades
- A random card will show up
- The current team member who is playing has 1min to go through as many cards as they can
- The score keeper writes down how many cards the player got 
- Once the 1 min is up it is the next teams turn and the process repeats


## Overview
- Each team has one player go each turn, the current player has 1 min to go through as many cards as possible


## Future Updates (salad bowl version)
- Have three levels where it loops through the deck three times
- Level 1: The player can say as many words as they want to get their team member to guess the card
- Level 2: The player can only say one word to describe the card
- Level 3: The player can say no words and provide only actions to describe the card
